# EEE 105 1s2223 | Course Guide

Hi everyone! Welcome to EEE 105. In this course, you will essentially learn how to connect your ideas of logic gates to modern computing devices, such as the ones found in your phone or your laptop.

### Mode of Delivery

I will deliver this course **remotely**, and hold classes **asynchronously**. I will release lecture materials and assessments **once every two weeks**, with the deadline at the end of the second week. 

Lab classes will be held by Sir Zyrel Renzo Sanchez separately.

### Communication

You will automatically be enrolled into an UVLE course site. You should be able to see that you are enrolled in **EEE 105 - THX**

For the lecture, I will post course materials, announcements and updates on the course in the UVLE as well.

My name is Lawrence Quizon, you can contact me through email at lawrence.quizon@eee.upd.edu.ph 

I am available for consultation on any weekday.

### Class Materials (Lecture)

Every two weeks, I will provide a:
1. Study Guide for the topic
2. Quiz for the topic
3. Every two topics, I will give a **problem set**.

I will give a quiz at the end of every topic, so be sure to follow the study guide.

### Problem Sets and Deadlines

The deadlines for the problem sets are going to be a week after their last topic. Hence:

1. Problem Set 1 - October 7
2. Problem Set 2 - November 4
3. Problem Set 3 - December 2
4. Problem Set 4 - January 6

Quizzes will open and close along with their respective topics.

### Grading

$$ LecGrade = 0.5*Quizzes+0.5*ProblemSets $$
$$ FinalGrade = 0.5*LabGrade+0.5*LecGrade $$

You need at least 60% LecGrade to pass the lecture class, without getting less than 50% on any module.

You need 60% FinalGrade to pass the course. You must pass both lec and lab.

UP Grade conversion scale is as below, applied after rounding Final Grades to the nearest integer:

|  Low  |  High   |   UP Grade   |
| -- | --- | ---- |
| 92 | 100 | 1    |
| 88 | 92  | 1.25 |
| 84 | 88  | 1.5  |
| 80 | 84  | 1.75 |
| 76 | 80  | 2    |
| 72 | 76  | 2.25 |
| 68 | 72  | 2.5  |
| 64 | 68  | 2.75 |
| 60 | 64  | 3    |
| 0  | 60  | 5    |
