# Module Intro 

In this module, you will learn the basics about what a computer is, what computer instructions are, MIPS, and details of MIPS instructions.

This 2-week module is divided into 4 subtopics. Some topics have quizzes- so make sure to do them.

## Topic 1: Computers

A **computer** is a machine that has inputs and outputs. It accepts input information, such as a mouse stroke, processes this information, and produces some resulting output information.

Of computers, digital computers are the most common and widespread kind. This course will be concerned mostly on the organization and workings of digital von-neumann architecture computers.

### **Study questions:**
1. What do you think qualifies as a computer?
2. Try to describe what happens when you press the keys on your keyboard.
3. What happens when your computer doesn't have an OS?
4. Do research and find:
   1. What is a BIOS?
   2. What is archlinux?

## Topic 2: Instructions

**Instructions** are how we tell digital computers what to do.

**Study Questions**
1. How do you think instructions are stored in memory?
2. What design choices would go into designing a computer?
3. Does a computer architecture and its instructions need to be co-designed?

## Topic 3: MIPS Instructions I

**MIPS** is a simple and popular computer architecture. It is a **reduced instruction set computer (RISC)**, meaning it has fewer and simpler instructions.

Instructions are fed to digital computers in **binary form**. To be human readable, this **binary form** can be translated one-to-one into a language called **assembly**; which may differ per computer architecture.

## Topic 4: MIPS Instructions II

The registers in mips have "suggested" usages. For example, $1 ($at) is used by pseudoinstructions, which you can think of as compound instructions- more than one but written with one line.
